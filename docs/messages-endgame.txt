    When a player dies:
    {
        'type':'death',
        'id':dead player's id
    }
    If the id is current_player's id the game shows a message that you died.
    Otherwise, just remove the player from the game.
    
    When the game finishes:
    {
        'type':'gameend',
        'winner':winning player's id
    }
    If there was just 1 player, winner is 'THE BOMBS'.

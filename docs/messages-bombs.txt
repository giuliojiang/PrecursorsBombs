SERVER -> CLIENT
    
    To display/remove the bomb
    server->client
    {
        "type":"bomb",
        "no": 555, // each bomb is numbered
        "action":"add", // can be add or remove
        "x":12, // these numbers are doubles, not ints
        "y":20
    }
    When removing a bomb, x and y coordinates are ignored.



    To display/remove explosion effect
    server->client
    {
        "type":"exp", // stands for Explosion
        "x", 12,
        "y", 20,
        "shape", "+"
    }
    shapes:
    "-" a horizontal explosion
    "|" a vertical explosion
    "+" a cross explosion
    If a cell (x, y) is already showing explosion "-" and receives a "|", it becomes a "+".
    Explosion duration is kept by the client, as it doesn't affect the logic of the game.
